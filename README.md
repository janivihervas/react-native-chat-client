# React Native Chat Client

This is a training project of me learning [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
Currently iOS is buggy as I have been developing this only on Android.

Main libraries used:

  - [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
  - [Redux Loop](https://github.com/raisemarketplace/redux-loop)
  - [ImmutableJS](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)
  - [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
  - [Chai](http://chaijs.com/)
  - [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul)
  

## Setup

1. [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content)
